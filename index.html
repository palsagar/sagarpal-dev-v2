## Hi, I'm Sagar Pal

I'm a **Research Scientist/Engineer** at [Entalpic](https://www.entalpic.ai/), working on computational modeling at the intersection of physics, machine learning, and industrial R&D.

### Background

I have a background in **mechanical engineering** and have spent years in academia working on **multiphase fluid dynamics** — specifically the complex flow physics of fluid fragmentation (droplets, sprays, atomization). My work spans both deterministic and stochastic modeling frameworks.

### Expertise

- **Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)**
- **High Performance Computing (HPC)** — large-scale parallel implementations on supercomputing infrastructure
- **Computational Fluid Dynamics** — multiphase flows, heat & mass transfer, thermal radiation
- **Numerical Methods** — coupled non-linear PDEs, optimization, perturbation theory
- **Stochastic Processes & Probabilistic Modeling**

### Current Work

At Entalpic, I develop computational models for large-scale industrial manufacturing processes. I work at the intersection of fluid dynamics, thermal physics, optimization, and advanced numerical methods to tackle real-world engineering challenges.

### Location

Based in **Paris, France** 🇫🇷
